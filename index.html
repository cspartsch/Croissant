        A croissant is a buttery, flaky, French viennoiserie pastry inspired by
        the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened
        laminated dough. Croissants are named for their historical crescent
        shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times
        in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
        laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to
        a puff pastry. Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the
        Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity but
        using brioche dough. Kipferls have long been a staple of Austrian, and
        French bakeries and pâtisseries. The modern croissant was developed in
        the early 20th century when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of
        the kipferl with a yeast-leavened laminated dough. In the late 1970s,
        the development of factory-made, frozen, preformed but unbaked dough
        made them into a fast food that could be freshly baked by unskilled
        labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie chain, was a
        French response to American-style fast food,and as of 2008, 30–40% of
        the croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from
        frozen dough. Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in
        many European countries.
